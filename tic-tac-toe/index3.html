            <!-- How to play the game -->

            <p>Choose a game regime. Point and click in a square to place a X mark. Make a diagonal, horizontal 
                or vertical lines of 3 squares to win a point. You play with the green X player and your aim is
                 to make 10 points before the red O player or 10 Ties. The classical rules of the game are 
                 explained in Class Subjects section.
