## Tic Tac Toe project was made using javascript, html and css. The game has 3 modes, 2 for player vs PC(one mode is easy and the other one is impossible, I have used a minimax algorithm) and one for player vs player. The player can choose with what will start and the match ends when one of the users made a diagonal, horizontal or vertical line of 3 squares, winning one point.
